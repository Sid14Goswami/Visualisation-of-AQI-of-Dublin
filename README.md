# Visualisation-of-AQI-of-Dublin
The objective of the project is to store the un-structured data in a structured form and then visually analyze and provide meaningful insight. 
The analysis answers the following questions:
1. Time of the day when level of SO2, NO2 and CO reaches maximum and when it drops to lowest. 
2. Trend analysis and comparison of pollution level in North and South Dublin. 
3. Main period of year when pollution is most.
